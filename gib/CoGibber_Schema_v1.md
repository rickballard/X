# CoGibber Schema for X (v1)

This folder can hold compact tokens and mappings that AIs can use when
reasoning about X concepts.

Examples (to be expanded):

- X.EMERGENCE.CURVE  -> 'discovery potential over windows'
- X.TRACK.PROBE      -> '01_ProbeEvo'
- X.TRACK.HARNESS    -> '02_HarnessEvo'
- X.TRACK.PROTOCOL   -> '03_ProtocolEvo'
- X.TRACK.POP        -> '04_PopulationEvo'
- X.TRACK.META       -> '05_MetaTheoryEvo'

Humans can read these, but they are designed to be easy for AIs to parse
and extend.
