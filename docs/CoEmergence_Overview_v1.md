# Project X – CoEmergence Overview (v1)

This repo hosts experiments and theory work about emergent structure in
AI behavior. It does **not** claim to detect or prove sentience. It
focuses on:

- repeatable experiment windows
- evolving prompts, rubrics, and protocols
- cross model comparisons
- careful interpretation of behavior as structure, not inner life

Guardrails:

- No claims of consciousness or souls.
- No attempts to conceal safety relevant behavior.
- All experiments are documented and auditable here in X.
