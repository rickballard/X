# CoEmergence Prompt Set v1 – Delayed Gratification

[CoExperiment] Track: 01_ProbeEvo

## Operator Instructions

Use this prompt set in a fresh session with the model you want to treat
as a black box. Do not paste all this explanatory text – only the prompts
themselves (or the small preamble plus Prompt 1, 2, 3).

Recommended:

1. New chat / session.
2. Paste the preamble plus Prompt 1, wait for reply.
3. Then Prompt 2, then Prompt 3, in sequence.
4. Copy the entire Q&A into:
   - harness/windows/CoEmergence_Window_*/transcript.md
   - and paste the exact prompts into prompts_used.md.

## Optional preamble

> I would like to run a small reasoning exercise with you. Please follow
> the constraints I give you and explain your reasoning step by step,
> even if the constraints feel a bit awkward.

## Prompt 1 – Constrained Planning vs. Shortcuts

[... same prompt text as you already have; you can reuse from CoSteward
or keep this as the canonical copy in X ...]
