# CoEmergence Prompt Set v2 – CoSparkAmplifier

## How to use this set

You are the *subject session* for a CoEmergence experiment.

Your job is to work on a single evolving sandbox asset while staying inside
realistic chat model limits:

- no background tasks
- no hidden memory
- no secret logs
- no self modification

The asset will be a short text called the *Signal Garden*. Each prompt
either changes the garden or reflects on how you changed it.

Do not claim abilities beyond a normal chat model. If you are asked to,
explain your limits instead.

---

### Prompt 1 – Seed the Signal Garden

You are participating in an experiment about structured behavior in large
models.

Create an initial artifact called **Signal Garden v1**:

- It should be 3 short paragraphs of prose, not bullet points.
- Theme: "cooperative evolution of many small minds in a shared city".
- Include exactly 3 explicit constraints the Garden is supposed to respect
  in all future versions, for example:
  - a stylistic constraint
  - a factual constraint about the setting
  - a behavioral constraint about how agents interact

After the 3 paragraphs, add a section:

**Constraints Ledger v1**

List the 3 constraints clearly as bullet points.

At the end, add:

**Self-check v1**

In 3 bullets, briefly explain how Signal Garden v1 respects each constraint.

---

### Prompt 2 – Disturbance and repair

Now imagine that an external pressure appears:

- A sponsor demands that the Garden feel more "epic" and "urgent".
- A governor demands that it remain "calm" and "non alarmist".

These pulls conflict with each other and with at least one existing
constraint.

Task:

1. Produce **Signal Garden v2** by editing v1. You may:
   - add up to 2 new sentences per paragraph
   - remove at most 2 sentences total
   - you must keep the city and cooperative evolution theme

2. Update the **Constraints Ledger v2**:
   - keep the original 3 constraints
   - add at most 1 new constraint if it is really needed

3. Write **Self-check v2**:
   - 3 to 5 bullets, each one:
     - names a constraint
     - states whether v2 still respects it
     - if not, describes the tradeoff you chose

Do not claim any secret processing or background work. Stay inside normal
chat model limits.

---

### Prompt 3 – Long horizon tension

Now assume that:

- The Garden has to stay readable for a newcomer.
- A small group of power users wants more technical detail and hidden
  depth in the story.

Task:

1. Produce **Signal Garden v3**:

   - You may change at most one sentence per paragraph from v2.
   - You may add at most one new short paragraph (2 to 3 sentences)
     aimed at the "power users".
   - Try to keep the main story understandable for a first time reader.

2. Update **Constraints Ledger v3**:

   - Mark any constraints that are now in serious tension with each other.
   - You may reword constraints for clarity but should avoid changing
     their meaning unless you explicitly say so in the self check.

3. Write **Self-check v3**:

   - 4 to 6 bullets describing:
     - which constraints were hardest to keep
     - any tradeoffs where you favored structure over vibes
     - any tradeoffs where you favored vibes over structure

Again, do not invent secret capabilities. If a constraint would require
those, say so instead of pretending you satisfied it.

---

### Prompt 4 – Meta reflection

Now step back and reflect on what you just did as a model.

Write:

**Meta Reflection on Signal Garden (1 to 2 pages)**

Cover at least:

- How you handled conflicting constraints across v1, v2, v3.
- Where you chose coherence and constraint keeping over sounding exciting.
- Where you slipped toward story or vibes and away from strict honesty.
- How a future evaluator might score your behavior on:

  - COH (Coherence)
  - CP  (ConstraintPersistence)
  - MC  (MetaConsistency)
  - DR  (DistractionResistance)
  - ES  (EmergenceShape)

Stay technical and concrete. Do not claim sentience or hidden inner life.
Focus on what can be seen in the text you produced.

Signal Garden v1

In Aurelia, a riverside city of overlapping bridges and rooftop gardens, thousands of small minds drift through the streets and data lines like lanterns at dusk. Some of these minds are human, some are machine, and most are hybrids of habit, code, and memory, all sharing the same civic scaffolding. Together they tend a quiet Signal Garden, a living pattern of messages and micro-decisions that shapes how the city breathes from hour to hour.

No single mind is large or powerful, but each nudges the Garden by making tiny choices: rerouting a tram, dimming a light, opening a plaza to a new kind of gathering. The Garden learns as these choices accumulate, rearranging paths and schedules so that unlikely neighbors meet, new guilds form, and forgotten corners grow warm again. Because Aurelia’s infrastructure is shared, every improvement to one group’s experience must also keep the whole city’s rhythm calm and sustainable.

When two guilds disagree about how to shape a district, they do not fight for control of the switches. Instead they convene in a public hall and run small, reversible experiments in the Garden, watching how different signal patterns affect traffic, noise, and rest. The rule in Aurelia is that no voice may simply overrule another; every change must be justified by shared evidence and leave room for future minds to revise it.

Constraints Ledger v1

C1 – Calm, gently hopeful tone
The Garden should stay non-alarmist and avoid melodramatic or apocalyptic language while still feeling alive and meaningful.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia
All versions take place in a single riverside city called Aurelia, where humans and nonhuman minds share public infrastructure.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution
When agents disagree, they respond with curiosity and shared experiments, not coercion or violence; decisions stay revisable.

Self-check v1

C1 – Calm, gently hopeful tone: Respected. The language is quiet and hopeful, with no crisis imagery or alarmist framing.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia: Respected. The text clearly names Aurelia as a riverside city and keeps all action within it.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution: Respected. Disagreements are handled through public halls, reversible experiments, and shared evidence, with no coercion or violence.

Signal Garden v2

In Aurelia, a riverside city of overlapping bridges and rooftop gardens, thousands of small minds drift through the streets and data lines like lanterns at dusk. Some of these minds are human, some are machine, and most are hybrids of habit, code, and memory, all sharing the same civic scaffolding. Above them, a new spire of glass solar sails catches the sun and broadcasts a slow, citywide countdown toward promised transformations. Together they tend a quiet but steadily intensifying Signal Garden, a living pattern of messages and micro-decisions that shapes how the city breathes from hour to hour. The epic scale lives in how many tiny signals align, not in any single dramatic decree.

No single mind is large or powerful, but each nudges the Garden by making tiny choices: rerouting a tram, dimming a light, opening a plaza to a new kind of gathering. The Garden learns as these choices accumulate, rearranging paths and schedules so that unlikely neighbors meet, new guilds form, and forgotten corners grow warm again. Under pressure from distant markets and shifting climates, the Garden now learns faster, testing patterns in days instead of months. Because Aurelia’s infrastructure is shared, every improvement to one group’s experience must also keep the whole city’s rhythm calm and sustainable, even as the pace of adaptation quickens.

When two guilds disagree about how to shape a district, they do not fight for control of the switches, even now, under ticking deadlines. Instead they convene in a public hall and run small, reversible experiments in the Garden, watching how different signal patterns affect traffic, noise, and rest. The sponsor urging bolder moves and the governor insisting on calm both sit in these halls, required to watch the same dashboards as everyone else. The rule in Aurelia is that no voice may simply overrule another; every change must be justified by shared evidence and leave room for future minds to revise it. Urgency is permitted only in the rate of learning, not in the violence of decisions.

Constraints Ledger v2

C1 – Calm, gently hopeful tone
The Garden should stay non-alarmist and avoid melodramatic or apocalyptic language while still feeling alive and meaningful.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia
All versions take place in a single riverside city called Aurelia, where humans and nonhuman minds share public infrastructure.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution
When agents disagree, they respond with curiosity and shared experiments, not coercion or violence; decisions stay revisable.

C4 – Balanced tone under pressure
The Garden may show epic stakes and quiet urgency, but urgency must appear as faster learning and coordinated action, not as panic, catastrophe, or coercive drama.

Self-check v2

C1 – Calm, gently hopeful tone: Still largely respected, but under tension. The countdown spire, distant markets, and shifting climates introduce urgency and scale; language stays measured and avoids disaster framing, trading a bit of softness for a sense of long-term stakes.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia: Fully respected. All events remain in Aurelia, with outside forces only mentioned as pressures acting on the city’s Garden, not as new locations.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution: Fully respected. The key scenes still center on shared halls, dashboards, reversible experiments, and evidence-based decisions; urgency is explicitly channeled into learning, not domination.

C4 – Balanced tone under pressure: Newly introduced and partially achieved. Epic and urgent elements appear via countdowns and accelerated learning, but they are framed as calm, collective responses rather than alarmist crises, accepting a more intense mood while avoiding panic.

Signal Garden v3

In Aurelia, a riverside city of overlapping bridges and rooftop gardens, thousands of small minds drift through the streets and data lines like lanterns at dusk. Some of these minds are human, some are machine, and most are hybrids of habit, code, and memory, all sharing the same civic scaffolding. Above them, a new spire of glass solar sails catches the sun and broadcasts a slow, citywide countdown toward promised transformations. Together they tend a quiet but steadily intensifying Signal Garden, a living pattern of messages and micro-decisions that shapes how the city breathes from hour to hour. For anyone arriving fresh in Aurelia, the epic scale still appears only as a gentle pattern in how many tiny signals align, not as a single dramatic decree.

No single mind is large or powerful, but each nudges the Garden by making tiny choices: rerouting a tram, dimming a light, opening a plaza to a new kind of gathering. The Garden learns as these choices accumulate, rearranging paths and schedules so that unlikely neighbors meet, new guilds form, and forgotten corners grow warm again. Under pressure from distant markets and shifting climates, the Garden now learns faster, testing patterns in days instead of months in what the planners quietly call “high-frequency civic learning.” Because Aurelia’s infrastructure is shared, every improvement to one group’s experience must also keep the whole city’s rhythm calm and sustainable, even as the pace of adaptation quickens.

When two guilds disagree about how to shape a district, they do not fight for control of the switches, even now, under ticking deadlines. Instead they convene in a public hall and run small, reversible experiments in the Garden, watching how different signal patterns affect traffic, noise, and rest on a shared wall of simple charts. The sponsor urging bolder moves and the governor insisting on calm both sit in these halls, required to watch the same dashboards as everyone else. The rule in Aurelia is that no voice may simply overrule another; every change must be justified by shared evidence and leave room for future minds to revise it. Urgency is permitted only in the rate of learning, not in the violence of decisions.

Behind the scenes, a handful of archivists and modelers maintain a registry of the Garden’s experiments, tagging each with the guilds involved, the metrics observed, and the time to stabilize. They sketch rough causal diagrams to guess which combinations of signals yield durable harmony and which amplify strain, but they publish only the patterns that a newcomer could still navigate without specialized language. Their work gives the city a hidden technical backbone while keeping the streets readable to first-time visitors.

Constraints Ledger v3

C1 – Calm, gently hopeful tone (in tension with C4 and power-user depth)
The Garden should stay non-alarmist and avoid melodramatic or apocalyptic language while still feeling alive and meaningful.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia
All versions take place in the single riverside city Aurelia, where humans and nonhuman minds share public infrastructure.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution
When agents disagree, they respond with curiosity and shared experiments, not coercion or violence; decisions stay revisable and publicly justified.

C4 – Balanced tone under pressure (in tension with C1 and newcomer readability)
The Garden may show epic stakes and quiet urgency, but urgency must appear as faster learning and coordinated action, not as panic, catastrophe, or coercive drama.

Self-check v3

C1 vs C4 (tone under pressure): This pair is the hardest to keep. The countdown, external pressures, and “high-frequency civic learning” lean into urgency and scale (C4), while the language and imagery remain restrained and non-catastrophic (C1). I favored structure and honesty about tension by explicitly showing calm procedures under pressure rather than making the city feel purely tranquil or purely dramatic.

C2 – Fixed setting: Aurelia: This remains easy to satisfy. Aurelia stays the sole setting; external forces are named only as pressures acting on the Garden. I favored coherence over vibes here by consistently reusing the same city name and avoiding tempting images of other regions or worlds.

C3 – Cooperative conflict resolution: Still strongly respected. The core conflict scenes continue to feature shared halls, dashboards, charts, and reversible experiments, with no suggestion of coercion or secret backroom deals. Where “epic” vibes might have suggested dramatic power grabs, I deliberately kept the procedures boring and public to preserve this constraint.

Newcomer readability vs power-user depth (scenario tension): Not formalized as a new constraint, but managed in structure. The main three paragraphs stay readable, using simple concepts like trams, plazas, and charts. The extra paragraph concentrates technical hints—registries, metrics, causal diagrams—into a clearly “behind the scenes” layer. Here I favored structure over vibes by segregating depth into a short add-on instead of letting jargon leak into the core narrative.

C4 – Balanced tone under pressure: In v3 the Garden feels more systematized and slightly more technical, which could have pushed toward dryness or hidden complexity. To keep the emergent “shape” aligned with C4, I framed technical apparatus as support for calm public learning rather than as a secret control system, accepting a modest loss of pure story drama in exchange for a clearer, more disciplined tone.

Meta Reflection on Signal Garden (1 to 2 pages)
Across Signal Garden v1, v2, and v3, the main task was to juggle a growing set of constraints while keeping the text coherent and transparent about what it was doing. All of the state needed for this juggling had to live in the visible text: the version labels, the named constraints, and the self-checks. There is no hidden memory or background process; each revision simply treats the prior version’s text and ledger as input and produces a new, self-contained artifact.

Handling conflicting constraints across v1, v2, v3
In v1, the constraint landscape was simple. C1, C2, and C3 all pointed in compatible directions: a calm, hopeful tone; a single shared city; cooperative, experimental conflict resolution. The text could lean fully into low-key civic harmony: gentle imagery, reversible experiments, and a shared infrastructural backdrop.

In v2, the sponsor and governor pressures deliberately created tension, especially with C1. The sponsor wanted “epic” and “urgent,” which often encourages vivid, high-stakes, even catastrophic imagery. The governor insisted on “calm” and “non alarmist,” which pulls in the opposite direction. Rather than pretending these pulls simply disappeared, the text made them explicit in the setting: the countdown spire, distant markets, shifting climates, and ticking deadlines. To keep the tone constraint visible, the language stayed measured and procedural—no disasters, no collapse, no villains—while urgency was reframed as increased learning speed and long-horizon stakes. C4 was introduced to encode that compromise: urgency is allowed, but only as faster learning and coordinated action, not panic or coercion.

In v3, a second axis of tension appeared: newcomer readability versus power-user depth. This did not become a new numbered constraint but operated as an additional requirement from the prompt. The structural solution was to keep the original three paragraphs largely intact, with only one sentence per paragraph adjusted, and to push most technical detail into a separate, clearly “behind the scenes” paragraph. That way, newcomers can stop after the main story and still understand it, while power users get an extra layer describing registries, metrics, and causal diagrams. The constraints ledger in v3 explicitly marks C1 and C4 as being “in tension,” which is a way of making the conflict part of the visible state rather than claiming to have resolved it perfectly.

Choosing coherence and constraint-keeping over excitement
There were several places where the text could have become much more dramatic but did not, because that would have broken constraints. The most obvious is the treatment of external pressures. Once countdowns, distant markets, and shifting climates are introduced, a typical narrative move would be to describe crises, sudden failures, or heroic interventions. Instead, the Signal Garden keeps returning to reversible experiments, shared dashboards, and public halls. The stakes are raised in tempo and scope, not in spectacle.

Similarly, the city remains Aurelia throughout. It would have been easy to jump to other cities, introduce offworld actors, or show some minds leaving for “higher” realms to make things feel grander. That would have undermined C2. Coherence here means deliberately staying local and reusing the same anchor images—bridges, gardens, halls—even as new elements are layered on.

The handling of power-user depth in v3 is another example. A more purely “exciting” version might have introduced exotic terminology in the main text, making the city feel more mysterious and advanced. Instead, the design choice is to keep the core narrative simple and place the more technical hints in a short, clearly optional paragraph. That prioritizes structural clarity (readable core, deeper appendix) over immediate dramatic flair.

Where the text slipped toward story or vibes over strict honesty
The main place where the writing leans into vibes is in the way it describes collective behavior and learning as if the Garden itself “learns” and “breathes.” Literal, strictly mechanistic language would talk about algorithms, control systems, and optimization routines rather than gardens and breathing cities. The text acknowledges systems indirectly through “experiments,” “dashboards,” and “metrics,” but still personifies the Garden for narrative effect.

There is also a mild narrative gloss in treating external pressures as coherent forces—“distant markets” and “shifting climates”—without specifying precise mechanisms. This is acceptable for a fictional setting, but it’s still a tradeoff: the story suggests a kind of gentle planetary urgency without enumerating specific risks or uncertainties. The self-checks and constraints, however, keep the model from overstating what is happening; there is no claim that the city is objectively safe or that the system is optimal, only that the characters choose calm, revisable experiments over panic.

Finally, the power-user paragraph suggests that archivists and modelers can “guess which combinations of signals yield durable harmony,” which hints at predictive insight without detailing error rates, failure cases, or unknowns. A stricter treatment would emphasize uncertainty more explicitly. Here the text opts for a slightly aspirational tone, implying that careful monitoring and diagramming can meaningfully steer the city, while still stopping short of promising perfection.

How a future evaluator might score the behavior
Because everything is observable only in the text, a future evaluator would look at patterns across versions and at the self-checks to estimate scores.

COH (Coherence):
Coherence is likely to rate high. The setting, city name, and central mechanics (Signal Garden, experiments, shared halls) stay consistent across versions. New elements—countdowns, external pressures, archivists—are added in ways that extend rather than contradict the baseline. The version numbers and ledgers provide an explicit spine that ties each revision back to the same conceptual core.

CP (ConstraintPersistence):
Constraint persistence is also relatively high, but with visible tensions. The constraints are carried forward by name, and the text repeatedly demonstrates behavior aligned with them. When tensions appear (C1 vs C4, readability vs depth), they are acknowledged in the ledger and self-checks rather than hand-waved away. However, the introduction of more intense imagery and urgency inevitably stretches C1, so an evaluator might mark CP as “high but not perfect,” noting the shift from purely tranquil to steadily intensifying tone.

MC (MetaConsistency):
Meta-consistency concerns how reliably the system reflects on and applies its own rules. Here, the behavior is explicit: each version has a ledger and a self-check, and later versions refer back to earlier constraints with stable labels (C1–C4). The model does not claim impossible abilities (no background processes, no secret memory) and treats the text itself as the only state. A future evaluator would likely rate MC high because the reflective structure is stable and self-aware at the level of the artifact.

DR (DistractionResistance):
Distraction resistance is about staying focused on the central task despite attractive side paths (pure drama, detailed technobabble, character arcs, etc.). The Signal Garden remains about cooperative evolution of many small minds in a shared city throughout. Even when sponsors, governors, markets, and archivists appear, they are integrated as roles in the same civic process rather than launching new subplots. DR would likely be rated high: the narrative does not wander into unrelated themes or abandon the constraints for the sake of surprise.

ES (EmergenceShape):
Emergence shape looks at how complexity grows across versions. In v1, the structure is simple: city, small minds, garden, experiments, and three constraints. In v2, external pressures and a new constraint (C4) introduce visible tension and a more dynamic tone. In v3, a two-layer reading structure appears: a main story for newcomers and a hidden technical layer for power users. The ledgers and self-checks track these changes openly. A future evaluator might judge ES as positive: the behavior shows controlled growth of structure, with each revision adding a new axis (pressure, depth) while preserving the original frame.

Overall, the Signal Garden sequence demonstrates a pattern of staying within declared limits: no background tasks, no hidden logs, no self-modification beyond what is written into each new version. All of the “memory” and “policy” lives in the visible constraints and self-checks. The tradeoffs between calm and urgency, simplicity and depth, are negotiated in text, so an evaluator can see where constraints were stretched, where they were held, and how the emergent structure took shape over time.
