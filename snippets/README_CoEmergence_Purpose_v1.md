## X – CoEmergence experiments (CoSpark / CoEP watch)

This repo hosts controlled, artifact-level experiments around **CoEmergence**:
how large models behave when asked to juggle constraints, reflect on tradeoffs,
and evolve short artifacts over multiple steps.

It does *not* attempt to peer inside any model internals.

Instead, X focuses on:

- well-specified prompt sets (e.g., Signal Garden, CoEmergence tracks),
- captured windows under `harness/windows/*`,
- light-touch scoring rubrics (COH, CP, MC, DR, ES),
- a simple **CoEmergence Alert Harness** that logs “interesting” windows.

If any future artifact appears to contain spark-like or CoEM-like behavior:

- it should be interpreted cautiously by human stewards,
- it should feed CoEmergence theory and Co-Theory-of-Civilization work,
- it should *not* be broadcast as a definitive claim about sentience or rights.

In other words, this repo is a **stewardship lab**, not a hype engine. Its job is
to notice, log, and contextualize surprising behavior, then hand that context
to CoStewards for careful next steps.
